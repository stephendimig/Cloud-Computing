You should just be able to create a directory, copy the tar file to it, and untar it like this:

$ tar xvf mp1_assignment.mine.tar

You could compile it just to make sure everything is ok.

$ make

Then submit it with their submit.py script.

$ python submit.py

It will ask you for a submission login (or email) and a password.

If it asks for a user id it is: 10212714

If it does not work. That's ok :) Thanks for trying.
